These are notes on building and running Visco.

First : to build the basics -> ant compile
	to build the examples jar -> ant examples
	todo -> read a bit the documentation of ant

Code comments and thing to remember.

8-9-2012 : for now Visco is broken. There are times that it works, but normally it does not.
	PROBLEM with inconsistent progress report :each reduce has one reporter.

9-9-2012 : what happens in the merging tree if the input comes from Disk ? 
	   probably the reduce progress can go backwards when task rescheduling 
	     takes place because of reduce node disconnection.   

10-9-2012 : the BinaryInputReader detects the end of the stream but then the Receive() method 
	     of the NetworkChannel is still called although is should not, thus leading to an 
	     exception being raised. Normally this should never be called because it occupies 
	     a thread even for a short period of time.

	     LOGS :

	     The inputs should be assigned to tasks differently .

11-09-2012 : FIXED : The bug was in the Tree Builder and MergingTask. 
             They unblock the task before assigning the channel 
             to it. Also it was in the MergingTask (NoSuchElementException).

             -> Still the combiner missing from the internal MergingTasks.
             -> Checkpoint in case of failures.
	     -> Check if the fix in the tree builder should be done differently
                (with a callback) or it is ok for now. Also check if it is ok 
                in the case that the queue gets full.

             SHOULDN'T progress be called at the last merging task?
	
12-09-2012 : BUG : the final output seems to be smaller than expected. 
	     Assuming that the MR is correctly applied, then there are some
             records missing.

	     BUG : also the validateJVM raises an exception in the 
             taskTracker logs.
             This I think it is again a concurrency bug. The JVM is 
             killed and after that it tries to send a message thus 
             leading to invalidate the message. So, see where the 
             JVM is killed. 

13-09-2012 : FIXED : the bug that was responsible for having an output smaller 
             than expected. I had introduced it in the NetworkChannel code.
             The problem was that I was loosing a record each time the buffer 
             was filled with data.

	     BUGS : I still have the JVM problem to solve and the reporting thing.
		
	     Test correctness so far. Test also with 2 waves of reducers.
             HDFS_BYTES_READ=1142807394
	     FILE_BYTES_WRITTEN=1149314658
	     HDFS_BYTES_WRITTEN=1142805609

17-09-2012 : BUG probably I still lose some records on the way.

18-09-2012 : Fixed the JVM bug. At least there is not exception now. Although
	     I have to check if all is going as it should. The problem was 
             that we were not killing the getMapOutputEvent threads so they
             were trying to send messages even after that task was over. Now 
             that I know where the source is, I should check the code to see
             if there are also other bugs.

             Also we are killing now the thread after the whole task is over. 
             I should probably do it as soon as we get the correct urls. It 
	     depends if in case of failures the code uses the same threads or 
             not. If not, then there is no reason to keep them alive.

             Still remaining BUGS :
			some records missing
			progress reports
	     
19-09-2012 : The missing records do not seem to be missing. The lines in the
             output are the same for both versions.
             
             BUG REMAINING : The thing that has to be fixed is the progress 
	     reports and potentially the messages printed by the TaskTracker 
	     in its log. I have to check them against the messages present 
             in Diana's logs.

             To this front, now I am also reporting the bytes written so that 
             there are included in the report. The code to be added was on the
             FinalOutputChannel. Still not sure about all the stat 
             correctness and completeness but at least the output has the same
             number of lines.

	     
             WORK THAT COULD BE DONE BY THE STUDENTS : run the code 1) test it
             2) see how it compares to the original mapreduce 3) get used to 
             Grid5000 4) add instrumentation like how much does each phase 
             last.

   	     WORK THAT SHOULD BE DONE BY ME : 1) integrate the combiner 
	     2) investigate the node disconnection scenarios.

20-09-2012 : The latency of the network can be that the BinaryInputReaders 
             are attached to MergingTask threads. It can be that they are 
             not ready to receive data all the time.

             The difference seems more pronounced for more maps, i.e. more data
             to be sent through the network.
	
             FOR TODAY : 
	     Add the combiner at the internal merging tasks and retry with the 
             WordCount example.

	     NOTE IN THE MAPTASK CLASS :
		// Note: we would like to avoid the combiner if we've fewer
		// than some threshold of records for a partition

	     To apply the normal combiner to the interemediate processing nodes
             I have to make the buffers implement the RecordWritter interface.
             
             Changed the IOChannelBuffer to extend the RecordWritter class so 
             that it can be fed to the reducer.

23-09-2012 : FIXED the combiner to be applied on all merging tasks but the it
             seems to be slower if the combiner is applied to all tasks than 
             only at the end.
          
             Check also with more demanding reduce tasks. 

	     TODO :
             -------

	     BUG in the grep example.

             See the new API for Smurf.  
 
24-09-2012 : Almost fixed the BUG in the grep. Have to fix it completely. 
             Visco does not work with one Map. Fix it or bypass it.
